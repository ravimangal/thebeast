# Installation #

For install instructions have a look [here](Installation.md).

# Manual #

The distribution includes a [manual](http://thebeast.googlecode.com/svn/tags/thebeast-0.0.2/doc/manual.pdf). However, it is far from complete. We thus recommend to also have a look at the [updated version](http://thebeast.googlecode.com/svn/branches/thebeast-0.0.x/doc/manual.pdf).

Note that for some googlecode related reason (I suppose) clicking on the links to the manuals shows the source code  of the pdf file. For now you need to "right-click download" and then open the downloaded file.

# Tutorials #

There are several (well, two for now) [tutorials](Tutorials.md) to get you started. Highly recommended: use the corresponding files as starting point for your own projects.
