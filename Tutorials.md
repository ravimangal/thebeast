# Tutorials #

It is difficult to pack all features of `thebeast` into a single application while keeping things easy and understandable. Hence we present some aspects in different tutorials based on different applications.

Here is an overview of the available tutorials so far and what they cover. We recommend to start with the first one an process this list sequentially.

  1. [Semantic Role Labelling Tutorial](SRLTutorial.md) Introducing:
    * local features,
    * deterministic cardinality constraints,
    * global predicates,
    * feature collection,
    * online learning,
    * testing
    * inspection
  1. [Alignment Tutorial](AlignmentTutorial.md) Introducing:
    * global weighted constraints,
    * real-valued formulae,
    * more inspections.
